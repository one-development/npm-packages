# Features

One UI provides a variety of useful features and functionality that make building applications a breeze.

- [Accessibility](#accessibility)
- [Theming](#theming)
- [Style Props](#style-props)
- [Utilities](#utilities)

## Accesibility

One UI is built with the understanding that accessibility is a requirement. Accordingly, One UI components support accessibility out of the box and include helpful summarizes of relevant accessibility guidance. Check out our [input](/?path=/docs/components-input--basic) component for a great example.

## Theming

One UI has two default themes and built-in support for complex theming. The theme is structured as a JavaScript object, based on the [Styled System Theme Specification](https://styled-system.com/theme-specification). You can [learn more](/?path=/docs/theming--page) about theming and even [create](/?path=/story/tools-theme-builder--basic) your own.

Expand the interactive theme object below to inspect its properties:

<ThemeProvider theme={lightTheme}>
  <Box
    marginTop='20px'
    marginBottom='24px'
    padding='20px'
    border='thin'
    borderRadius='4px'
    boxShadow='xs'
  >
    <Inspector data={lightTheme} expandLevel={1} />
  </Box>
</ThemeProvider>

## Style Props

Many One UI components support _Style Props_, which make it easy to reference theme values for CSS properties like _margin_, _color_, _height_, or _width_. Style Props make components more declarative and eliminate the need to write custom style rules.

```javascript
<Box
  color='onSurface.primary' // theme.color.onSurface.primary
  margin='md' // theme.space.md
  height='100%' // uses 100% height as custom value
  width='containedWidth' // theme.sizes.containerWidth
>
  This is a box
</Box>
```

What's more, style props support _responsive_ values, which make it simple to adjust style prop values for different screen sizes.

```javascript
// You can pass an object (or array), which uses breakpoint aliases as keys
<Box
  padding={{ default: 'md', sm: 'lg' }}
  marginX={{ default: 'md', xs: 'lg', md: 'auto' }}
>
  This is a box
</Box>
```

## Utilities

One UI exports a variety of useful functions and hooks to support rapid application development. You can read more about them [here](/?path=/story/utils-reference--page).

```javascript
import { useEventListener } from '@one-dev/ui'

function Input(props) {
  useEventListener('scroll', () => {
    console.log('window scrolled')
  })

  return <div>This page logs to the console on scroll events</div>
}
```
